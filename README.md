# Welcome to OpenSPortSensor
Telemetry for *FrSky* RC Receivers using the **SPort** interface.

The main goals for this project were:
- Provide a software easy to adapt for your own sensors by implementing a simple interface
- Support different *Arduino* boards by using high level libraries for communication only
- Support Hardware- and Software-Serial interfaces
- Supply a set of standard sensors for e.g. voltage and current measurement
